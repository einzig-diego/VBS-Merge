# VBS-Merge
A tool to merge several VBScript files together into one

# Build
I used Dev-Cpp with TDM-GCC 4.8.1 64-bit Release build option.

# Important
When compiled and ran for the first time, it will add a context menu item for .vbs files into the shell that allows to merge a vbs file with left click->"Merge includes with VBS-Merge".
